# potat-leaf-disease-classification-mobilenet-customs-variants
Enhancing Potato Leaf Disease Classification through MobileNet Variant custom models fine-tuning, transfer learning and data pre-processing techniques.

## Overview
This repository contains the code, experiments on improving potato leaf disease detection using MobileNet fine-tuning, transfer learning and advanced data pre-processing strategies. The project benchmarks MobileNetV1, V2, and V3-Small for real-time performance evaluation and accuracy measures. Furthermore, a comparison between the original MobileNetV1 and the custom fine-tuned models is carried out to highlight the improvements made with the changes on the model architecture.
